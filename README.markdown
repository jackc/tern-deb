# Tern - The SQL Fan's Migrator

Tern is a standalone migration tool for PostgreSQL.

## Features

* Multi-platform
* Stand-alone binary
* SSH tunnel support built-in
* Data variable interpolation into migrations

## Installation

    go get -u github.com/jackc/tern

## Creating a Tern Project

To create a new tern project in the current directory run:

    tern init

Or to create the project somewhere else:

    tern init path/to/project

Tern projects are composed of a directory of migrations and optionally a
config file. See the sample directory for an example.

# Configuration

Database connection settings can be specified via the standard PostgreSQL
environment variables (PGHOST, PGPORT, PGDATABASE, PGUSER, PGPASSWORD, and
PGSSLMODE), via program arguments, or in a config file. By default tern will
look in the current directory for the config file tern.conf and the
migrations.

The `tern.conf` file is stored in the `ini` format with two sections,
`database` and `data`. The `database` section contains settings for connection
to the database server.

Values in the `data` section will be available for interpolation into
migrations. This can help in scenarios where migrations are managing
permissions and the user to which permissions are granted should be
configurable.

If all database settings are supplied by PG* environment variables or program
arguments the config file is not required.

The entire `tern.conf` file is processed through the Go standard
`text/template` package. The program environment is available at `.env`.

Example `tern.conf`:

```ini
[database]
# host supports TCP addresses and Unix domain sockets
# host = /private/tmp
host = 127.0.0.1
# port = 5432
database = tern_test
user = jack
password = {{.env.MIGRATOR_PASSWORD}}
# version_table = schema_version
#
# sslmode generally matches the behavior described in:
# http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/libpq-ssl.html#LIBPQ-SSL-PROTECTION
#
# There are only two modes that most users should use:
# prefer - on trusted networks where security is not required
# verify-full - require SSL connection
# sslmode = prefer

# Proxy the above database connection via SSH
# [ssh-tunnel]
# host =
# port = 22
# user defaults to OS user
# user =
# password is not required if using SSH agent authentication
# password =

[data]
prefix = foo
app_user = joe

```

This flexibility configuration style allows handling multiple environments such
as test, development, and production in several ways.

* Separate config file for each environment
* Environment variables for database settings and optionally one config file
  for shared settings
* Program arguments for database settings and optionally one config file for
  shared settings

## Migrations

To create a new migration:

    tern new name_of_migration

This will create a migration file with the given name prefixed by the next available sequence number (e.g. 001, 002, 003).

The migrations themselves have an extremely simple file format. They are
simply the up and down SQL statements divided by a magic comment.

    ---- create above / drop below ----

Example:

```sql
create table t1(
  id serial primary key
);

---- create above / drop below ----

drop table t1;
```

If a migration is irreversible such as a drop table, simply delete the magic
comment.

```sql
drop table widgets;
```

To interpolate a custom data value from the config file prefix the name with a
dot and surround the whole with double curly braces.

```sql
create table {{.prefix}}config(
  id serial primary key
);
```

Migrations are read from files in the migration directory in the order of the
numerical prefix. Each migration is run in a transaction.

Any SQL files in subdirectories of the migration directory, will be available
for inclusion with the template command. This can be especially useful for
definitions of views and functions that may have to be dropped and recreated
when the underlying table(s) change.

```sql
// Include the file shared/v1_001.sql. Note the trailing dot.
// It is necessary if the shared file needs access to custom data values.
{{ template "shared/v1_001.sql" . }}
);
```

Tern uses the standard Go
[text/template](http://golang.org/pkg/text/template/) package so conditionals
and other advanced templating features are available if needed. See the
package docs for details.

## Migrating

To migrate up to the last version using migrations and config file located in
the same directory simply run tern:

    tern migrate

To migrate up or down to a specific version:

    tern migrate --destination 42

To migrate up N versions:

    tern migrate --destination +3

To migrate down N versions:

    tern migrate --destination -3

To migrate down and rerun the previous N versions:

    tern migrate --destination -+3

To use a different config file:

    tern migrate --config path/to/tern.json

To use a different migrations directory:

    tern migrate --migrations path/to/migrations

## SSH Tunnel

Tern includes SSH tunnel support. Simply supply the SSH host, and optionally
port, user, and password in the config file or as program arguments and Tern
will tunnel the database connection through that server. When using a SSH tunnel
the database host should be from the context of the SSH server. For example, if
your PostgreSQL server is `pg.example.com`, but you only have SSH access, then
your SSH host would be pg.example.com and your database host would be
`localhost`.

Tern will automatically use an SSH agent if available.

## Embedding Tern

All the actual functionality of tern is in the github.com/jackc/tern/migrate
library. If you need to embed migrations into your own application this
library can help.

## Running the Tests

To run the tests tern requires a test database to run migrations against.

1. Create a new database for main tern program tests.
1. Open testdata/tern.conf.example
1. Enter the connection information.
1. Save as testdata/tern.conf.
1. Create another database for the migrate library tests.
1. Open migrate/connection_settings_test.go.example.
1. Enter the second database's connection information.
1. Save as migrate/connection_settings_test.go.

    go test ./...

## Prior Ruby Gem Version

The projects using the prior version of tern that was distributed as a Ruby
Gem are incompatible with the version 1 release. However, that version of tern
is still available through RubyGems and the source code is on the ruby branch.
